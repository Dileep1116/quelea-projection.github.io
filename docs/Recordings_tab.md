Path for recordings
-------------------

Set the path where you want audio recordings to be stored.

Automatically convert recordings to MP3 files (requires VLC)
------------------------------------------------------------

Will automatically start converting a recording to a MP3 file once it is done and delete the original recording file. If you are not in need of any manual modification of the recording once it is done, the MP3 file will be much smaller in size and better for distribution. If, however, you want to edit the file in a separate software, for instance to adjust sound levels or delete silence, the default WAV format is better. Note that WAV files will be significantly larger. If VLC is not found, this option will be disabled.
