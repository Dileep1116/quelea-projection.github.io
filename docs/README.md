# Quelea docs

Here houses the markdown source for the Quelea documentation, hosted at https://quelea-projection.github.io/docs/.

Pull requests are very welcome if you spot an issue (however small that might be - PR's for typos are fine!) or want to improve / extend the docs. If you're planning a particularly big change though, please create an issue to let us know first so we can discuss its implementation (otherwise you risk it not being accepted.)
